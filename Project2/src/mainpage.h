 *
 * The purpose of this software is to calculate the result of an election with at most 1000 candidates and with the maximum number of ballots is 10,000. It supports two voting methods: the Plurality and the Droop Quota. The Plurality will select winners based on the highest number of votes. Candidates owning more ballots will be declared winners. For Droop Quota, winners will be selected if they reach droop at any point. The ballots of the losers will then be redistributed to find other winners. The software also supports the audit process in which an audit file will be generated in the user favor to simulate the election.
